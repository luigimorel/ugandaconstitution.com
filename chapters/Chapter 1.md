The Constitution.
```

1. Sovereignty of the people.

(1) All power belongs to the people who shall exercise their
sovereignty in accordance with this Constitution.

(2) Without limiting the effect of clause (1) of this article, all
authority in the State emanates from the people of Uganda; and the people
shall be governed through their will and consent.

(3) All power and authority of Government and its organs derive from
this Constitution, which in turn derives its authority from the people who
consent to be governed in accordance with this Constitution.

(4) The people shall express their will and consent on who shall
govern them and how they should be governed, through regular, free and fair
elections of their representatives or through referenda.

2. Supremacy of the Constitution.

(1) This Constitution is the supreme law of Uganda and shall have
binding force on all authorities and persons throughout Uganda.

(2) If any other law or any custom is inconsistent with any of the
provisions of this Constitution, the Constitution shall prevail, and that other
law or custom shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void.

3. Defence of the Constitution.

(1) It is prohibited for any person or group of persons to take or retain
control of the Government of Uganda, except in accordance with the
provisions of this Constitution.

(2) Any person who, singly or in concert with others, by any violent
or other unlawful means, suspends, overthrows, abrogates or amends this
Constitution or any part of it or attempts to do any such act, commits the
offence of treason and shall be punished according to law.

 
(3) This Constitution shall not lose its force and effect even where its


observance is interrupted by a government established by the force of arms;
and in any case, as soon as the people recover their liberty, its observance
shall be reestablished and all persons who have taken part in any rebellion or
other activity which resulted in the interruption of the observance shall be
tried in accordance with this Constitution and other laws consistent with it.

(4) All citizens of Uganda shall have the right and duty at all times—
(a) to defend this Constitution and, in particular, to resist any person
or group of persons seeking to overthrow the established
constitutional order; and
(b) to do all in their power to restore this Constitution after it has
been suspended, overthrown, abrogated or amended contrary to
its provisions.

(5) Any person or group of persons who, as required by clause (4) of
this article, resists the suspension, overthrow, abrogation or amendment of
this Constitution commits no offence.

(6) Where a person referred to in clause (5) of this article is punished
for any act done under that clause, the punishment shall, on the restoration of
this Constitution, be considered void from the time it was imposed, and that
person shall be taken to be absolved from all liabilities arising out of the
punishment.

4. Promotion of public awareness of the Constitution.

The State shall promote public awareness of this Constitution by—
(a) translating it into Ugandan languages and disseminating it as
widely as possible; and
(b) providing for the teaching of the Constitution in all educational
institutions and armed forces training institutions and regularly
transmitting and publishing programmes through the media
generally.
