them, as the case may be;  
(b) prohibit conduct—

of specified officers;  
(ii) likely to lead to corruption in public affairs; or  
(iii) which is detrimental to the public good or welfare or good
governance;  
(c) prescribe the penalties to be imposed for breach of the code,
without prejudice to the application of criminal penalties
prescribed for the breach in question;  
(d) prescribe powers, procedures and practices for ensuring the

The Leadership Code of Conduct shall be enforced by the Inspectorate of

235. Disqualification for breach of code.

disqualified from holding any other public office whether appointive or
elective and either generally or for a prescribed period.
